# Chatbot with PDF Document Integration
Welcome to the Chatbot with PDF Document Integration repository! In this project, we have developed a chatbot that utilizes information from the provided PDF documents to answer user queries. Additionally, if the PDF documents do not contain relevant information, the chatbot utilizes a local Language Model (LLM) to generate responses.

## Chat History
The chatbot maintains a conversation history for each user. You can view the entire chat history to see the flow of the conversation. This feature helps to keep track of the context, especially when a user asks multiple questions.
