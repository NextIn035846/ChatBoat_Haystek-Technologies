# Chatbot with PDF Document Integration
Welcome to the Chatbot with PDF Document Integration repository! In this project, we have developed a chatbot that utilizes information from the provided PDF documents to answer user queries. Additionally, if the PDF documents do not contain relevant information, the chatbot utilizes a local Language Model (LLM) to generate responses.

## Requirements
To use this chatbot, make sure you have the following requirements installed:

**Python 3.9**
Required Python packages (specified in requirements.txt)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the chatbot:

**Clone this repository to your local machine:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/chatbot-with-pdf-integration.git
```
**Navigate to the project directory:**
```bash
cd chatbot-with-pdf-integration
```
**Install the required dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**Run the chatbot:**
```bash
python chatbot.py
```
## Usage
The chatbot is now running and ready to assist you with any questions you may have. It uses the information extracted from the provided PDF documents to provide accurate responses. If a relevant response is not found in the PDFs, the chatbot falls back to the local Language Model.

## Chat History
The chatbot maintains a conversation history for each user. You can view the entire chat history to see the flow of the conversation. This feature helps to keep track of the context, especially when a user asks multiple questions.
